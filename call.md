## [Workshop on "What Indian HCI Doctoral researchers study?"](https://amitjenaiitbm.github.io/IndiaHCI2019/)

November 1-3, 2019
ISB Hyderabad, Hyderabad, India


Research proposal submission deadline: October 10, 2019

Young researchers (students through assistant-professor level, PhD in 2010 or later) working on performance engineering, software visualization or high-performance computing, are invited to apply for participation in the GI-Dagstuhl seminar on “Visualizing Systems and Software Performance (VSSP)”. VSSP will take place from July 9 until July 13 (Mon-Fri), 2018, in Dagstuhl, Germany. Schloss Dagstuhl – Leibniz Center for Informatics is a castle situated at the scenic countryside of Saarland. It is a world-renowned meeting place for computer scientists.

The seminar addresses the problem of visualizing large-scale performance data. Visualization of large-scale performance data is a topic that is studied by the performance engineering, software visualization, and high-performance computing communities. However, these research communities are mostly disjoint and mutually beneficial knowledge is rarely shared between them. In addition, the development of a new visualization technique is an iterative process, which requires continual back-and-forth feedback between visualization and performance researchers (or practitioners) to evaluate the applicability of the technique to a real-world problem. The gap between research communities hinders the evaluation of new techniques. The main goal of the GI seminar is to bring together young researchers (PhD students, postdocs or assistant professors) in the areas of (i) performance engineering, (ii) software visualization, and (iii) high-performance computing. Each field will present their current research efforts, and exchange experience and expertise, to discuss research challenges, and to develop ideas for future collaborations.

The seminar will be divided into two parts: (i) The first two days of the seminar will focus on getting up to speed with the newest work in the different research areas and (ii) the last three days of the seminar will be used to bootstrap collaborations by working on concrete topics in small breakout groups. During the first part of the seminar, the participants will give a short (5-10 minutes) presentation about their research interests and latest work. In addition, we will have spots for (1-hour) tutorials given by the participants. These tutorials will allow the participants to go in more depth and get hands-on experience with the latest performance engineering or visualization techniques and tools. We expect these tutorials will inform the bootstrap collaborations, giving participants the background necessary to incorporate real data into the breakout sessions.

GI-Dagstuhl Seminars are sponsored by the Gesellschaft für Informatik e.V. Accommodation and full board is 50 EUR per person and day (250 EUR total), excluding travel to Dagstuhl.

Reseac proposals for the workshop will be collected via [Google Form](https://forms.gle/orhVNL6iqUkANxeK6)

Applications are evaluated by the organisers of the worksop. To submit your research proposal, please fill the above google form. The form asks the following questions:

1. The university or organisation at which you are currently enrolled/working.

2. Context and motivation that drives your research.

3. Research objectives/goals/questions.

4. Background/literature review of key works that frame your research.

5. Hypothesis/thesis and/or problem statement.

6. Your research approach and methods, including relevant rationale.

7. Results to date and their validity.

8. Dissertation status and next steps.

9. Current and expected contributions.

10. Expected benefits of participation for both yourself and the other workshop participants (i.e., what will you contribute as well as gain).

Please note that the workshop specifically caters to young researchers (pre-Ph.D., current Ph.D. and post-Ph.D.). Hence, in the form some of the questions will be optional for the pre-Ph.D. participants as we don not expect them to have a well formulated research plan.

The deadline for proposal submission is October 10, 2019. Notifications will be sent out on or before October 20, 2019.
